In the first session, participants are presented with images of people in negative contexts. They are asked to imagine that they are the person in the picture and indicate, on a scale from 1 (Neutral) to 10 (Very Negative), how they feel. This part of the task is self-paced. Approximately one week later, participants come back to the lab and are shown how other people (for example, ingroup and outgroup members) rated the same images (sometimes no group feedback is presented). After each feedback presentation, participants are asked to rate the images once more. In reality, group ratings are experimentally manipulated based on the participants\u2019 initial ratings during the behavioral session. Participants are shown ratings that are higher (+2, +3, +4) and lower (-2, -3, -4) than their initial scores with an equal distribution of higher/lower scores.", "id": "tsk_ec4xbqynlG1uR"}}

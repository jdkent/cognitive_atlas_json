In this task, a series of red vertical and horizontal lines flash in a digital numeric frame (resembling a digital clock . The task is divided into two types of blocks: one in which the participant must press the spacebar whenever these lines form a complete number, and one in which the participant must press the spacebar whenever these lines form a complete letter. Each block lasts 1.5m. Each stimulus flashes for 300 milliseconds followed by a blank page displayed for 700 milliseconds, giving the participant 1 sec to respond to each trial. The participant practices both types of trials before the task begins.\r\n", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f", "id": "trm_56a2b7c08a279"}, "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_56a2a19d44b7c", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T23:23:38", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}, {"id": "tco_56a2a276b6786", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T23:24:01", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f997573eb4a"}, {"id": "cit_56a2ad9151928"}, {"id": "cit_56a2adbd49b3c"}]}

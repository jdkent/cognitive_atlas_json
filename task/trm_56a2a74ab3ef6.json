The subject is presented with pairs of faces. The MEDF presents a pair of faces and asks the participant to click the button labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Face\u00e2\u0080\u009d below the face that is showing more emotion (anger, fear, happiness, sadness , or the central button labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cEqual\u00e2\u0080\u009d if both faces are showing equal emotion. The stimuli are created using software to morph faces into differing intensities of emotion. For example, a 50  morph will be a 50  morph between a neutral face and the same identity expressing the target emotion. There are 36 trials in total, divided into happy, sad, angry, and fearful faces. Of the 36 trials, 4 show no emotional difference. The remaining 32 trials have emotion differentials in increments of 10  ranging from 10  - 60 , distributed more heavily toward 30  and 40  items. Trials are presented in random order, and the test is a forced-choice task with no time limit per trial. After the subject answers one trial, the test automatically moves to the next trial. Response time is recorded for each trial.\r\n", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f", "id": "trm_56a2a74ab3ef6"}}

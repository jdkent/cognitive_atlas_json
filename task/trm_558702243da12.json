The scale was originally developed for use in the evaluation of adult patients who were suffering from bipolar disorder, but has since been modified for use in pediatric patients. A similar scale was then developed to allow clinicians to interview parents about their children&#39;s symptoms, in order to ascertain a better diagnosis of mania in children. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the parent version of the scale.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Mania_Rating_Scale", "id_user": "usr_51bc76ae9636c", "id": "trm_558702243da12"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_55a6a486c0fca"}]}

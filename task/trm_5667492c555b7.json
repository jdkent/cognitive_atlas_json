In each round subjects are presented with 32 cards; some are gain cards, some are loss cards. Subjects are told how many points a gain card is worth, how many points a loss card costs, and how many loss cards there are in a round. Each round ends when a loss card is turned. In the cold version subjects choose how many cards they want to turn but don&#39;t see the result for the round until the end. In the hot version subjects click and turn each card themselves and sees their earning for that round.  In both conditions, subjects see their final score at the end of 27 rounds.

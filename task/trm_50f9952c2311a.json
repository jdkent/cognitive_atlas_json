Subjects decide which of 4 objects does not belong with the other 3 based on one of three sorting principles (e.g., shape, size, line thickness). Sorting principles change after 10 successive correct responses, and feedback is used to guide discovery of the principle and indicate its change. There are 4 alternate forms available. An accuracy score is calculated by multiplying the proportion of correct responses by the number of categories attained (out of 3 possible).", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f9952c2311a"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f99541d75ac"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d096f0"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50f9968ab6bc6", "event_stamp": "2013-01-18T18:38:23", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "tco_56a2a1af82f5d", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T22:05:35", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}, {"id": "tco_56a2a1fbe4ba0", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T22:14:24", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f995ddaecea"}, {"id": "cit_50f996115867e"}, {"id": "cit_50f9961c5412c"}]}

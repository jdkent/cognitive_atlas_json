Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures \r\n(e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwitch\u00e2\u0080\u009d trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. For example, after four straight trials matching on shape, the participant may be asked to match on color on the next trial and then go back to shape, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50eb115b6c476"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_50eb12042553f"}, {"id": "con_50eb123d568c0"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50eb12958b083"}, {"id": "cnt_50eb129d5a541"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d09764"}, {"id": "trm_4aae62e4ad209"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50f483e0a6bf9", "event_stamp": "2013-01-15T12:46:18", "id_user": "usr_49a467bf4e0db"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50eb124ae6727", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T18:22:02", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50eb12545dbff", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T18:22:12", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50eb12755902e", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T18:22:45", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50eb1321048fb"}, {"id": "cit_50eb133c004e6"}, {"id": "cit_50eb1357acb56"}]}

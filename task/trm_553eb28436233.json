Choosing the better or worse of the two options gives positive or negative feedback (smiley and sad faces).  For the actual task, participants performed a three-option choice task in which each option comprised one previously learned stimulus and one previously learned action. They are instructed to weight stimulus and action information equally on each trial and select the best option to obtain points that subsequently converted into monetary reward.

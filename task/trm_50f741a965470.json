The Graded Naming Test (GNT) avoids the problem of ceiling effects in previous naming tests by having subjects name drawings of objects in ascending difficulty. Reduced efficiency in retrieving the name of an object can be the first and only indication of impaired language functioning. This test assesses object-naming ability, but is in addition graded in difficulty to allow for individual differences. This means that it may be able to detect any word-finding difficulty even in those with an extensive naming vocabulary. Currently available in UK English only (this test is culturally biased and there are no alternative versions at present).", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f741a965470"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f741b1591cf"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b802"}], "PARTOF": [{"id": "trm_552174863d51e"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50ec58d050cf5", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T00:13:40", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50f741ba4c01c", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T00:11:38", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50f741c1d0d5f", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T00:11:45", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50f7420defc3c", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T00:13:01", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f741cd40415"}, {"id": "cit_50f741d7bd533"}, {"id": "cit_50f741f84438b"}]}

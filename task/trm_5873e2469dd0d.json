A list of pseudo-words (from the same distribution as jabberwocky)\r\n6. Consonant strings\r\nA probe is then presented and the subject has to respond whether it was one of 10 items of the previously presented sequence.\r\nEach trial lasts 10 seconds.\r\nContrasts between these conditions can be used to probe syntactic-specific or semantic-specific responses.", "id_user": "usr_583366685f18a", "id": "trm_5873e2469dd0d"}}

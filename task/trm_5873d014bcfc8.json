There are three categories of blocks constituted by a set of events related to specific conditions. Each block integrates two conditions of the same kind. They can be described as follows: \r\n1. mechanistic audio: interpret short stories (presented as auditory stimuli) through mental reply (no active response was involved), featuring a cause-consequence plot;\r\n2. mechanistic video: interpret short stories (presented as visual stimuli) through mental reply (no active response was\r\n  involved), featuring a cause-consequence plot;\r\n3 triangle mental: watch short movies of triangles, which\r\n  exhibit a putative movement;\r\n4 triangle random: watch short movies of triangles, which\r\n  exhibit a random movement;\r\n5 false belief audio: interpret short stories (presented as auditory stimuli) through mental reply (no active response was involved), featuring a false-belief plot;\r\n6 false belief video: interpret short stories (presented as visual stimuli) through mental reply (no active response was involved), featuring  a false-belief plot;\r\n7 speech sound: listen passively to short samples of human voices;\r\n8 non speech sound: listen passively to short samples of natural sounds.", "id_user": "usr_583366685f18a", "id": "trm_5873d014bcfc8"}}

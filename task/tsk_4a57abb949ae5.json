The task allows participants to select cards from four decks displayed on-screen. Participants are instructed that the selection of each card will result in winning or losing money. The objective is to attempt to win as much money as possible. (from http://iowagamblingtask.com/)\r\n\r\nOn each trial, participants select a card from one of four decks; two \u00e2\u0080\u0098bad\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decks offer a higher reward on most trials but also higher possible loss and lower overall expected value, whereas two \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decks offer a lower reward on most trials but lower possible loss and higher expected value. Participants learn the nature of the decks through trial-and- error.

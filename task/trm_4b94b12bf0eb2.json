Based on feedback from customers, we are introducing four new subtests and modifying three existing subtests.\r\n\r\n4 subtests were added:\r\n\r\n    * Spatial Addition\r\n    * Symbol Span\r\n    * Design Memory\r\n    * General Cognitive Screener\r\n\r\n3 subtests retained with modifications:\r\n\r\n    * Logical Memory\r\n      Although the stories remain the same as seen in WMS-III for ages 16-69 years old, the repetition trial for Story B has been dropped to increase the consistency with previous editions. For the older age range of 65-90 years old, a new story was developed with content more relevant. The story is shorter and repeated once to enable adequate floor through age 90. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n    * Verbal Paired Associates\r\n      It now includes a combination of difficult and easy items. For the younger age group (16-69 years) there are 14 items of which 10 are hard. For the older age group (65-90 years), there are 10 items of which six are hard. Delayed Free Recall Trial has been added while Recognition Trial has increased its level of difficulty. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n    * Visual Reproduction\r\n      While following the same structure and format as seen in WMS-III, there have been a few changes to the subtest. Recognition Trial has been shortened and scoring has been improved. Based on Munro Cullum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research, scoring is easier and faster than previously experienced and emphasizes recall with less focus on drawing accuracy. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n\r\n8 subtests were eliminated:\r\n\r\n    * Information & Orientation\r\n    * Spatial Span\r\n    * Mental Control\r\n    * Faces\r\n    * Digit Span\r\n    * Family Pictures\r\n    * Letter Number\r\n    * Word List (CVLT-II can be entered int", "id_user": "usr_4b94ae051eecc", "id": "trm_4b94b12bf0eb2"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_4e012e2269b4c"}, {"id": "con_4e012e64945d9"}, {"id": "con_4e012f7ba03d0"}, {"id": "con_4e012fc0a6afb"}, {"id": "con_4e01302681ad2"}, {"id": "con_4e01306ba8bb6"}, {"id": "con_4e013090c4ac2"}, {"id": "con_4e0130c9799c6"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_4e012e2269d7d"}, {"id": "cnt_4e012e64947cf"}, {"id": "cnt_4e012f7ba05e2"}, {"id": "cnt_4e012fc0a6d05"}, {"id": "cnt_4e01302681cd3"}, {"id": "cnt_4e01306ba8db6"}, {"id": "cnt_4e013090c4cf1"}, {"id": "cnt_4e0130c979bf1"}, {"id": "cnt_4e01329cad8aa"}, {"id": "cnt_4e0133e4d4fe1"}], "KINDOF": [{"id": "tsk_4a57abb949f12"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b457"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d09aa7"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b507"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0afa0"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0af7d"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_4e0131eb2ffb1", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:06:03", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_4e0131f94895e", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:06:17", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_4e0132087acee", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:06:32", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_4e013215c985c", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:06:45", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_4e013222a8eba", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:06:58", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_4e01322941548", "event_stamp": "2011-06-22T00:07:05", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_4e0130fb32bb2"}, {"id": "cit_4e012d85aad12"}, {"id": "cit_4e0131b7f019b"}]}

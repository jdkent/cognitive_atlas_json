Now, during the delayed recall (sVOLTd , participants are shown a series, one at a time, of 20 three-dimensional Euclidean shapes - the 10 shapes they were asked to memorize during the SVOLT mixed with 10 novel shapes. The participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task is to decide whether he/she has seen the shape before by clicking with the mouse on one of four buttons: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDEFINITELY YES\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPROBABLY YES\u00e2\u0080\u009d, &#34;PROBABLY NO&#34; and &#34;DEFINITELY NO&#34;.

Participants have 20 seconds to select a response before the test moves on to the next trial.

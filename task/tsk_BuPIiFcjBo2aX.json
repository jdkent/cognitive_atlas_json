On each trial, one \r\nstimulus is presented, and the participant must decide whether to make \r\nan avoidance response (press a key), or remain and face the consequences \r\nof that stimulus. Critically, making an avoidance response is associated \r\nwith a small cost (e.g. one additional aversive reinforcer administered \r\nat the end of each block for every 5 avoidance responses made during \r\nthat block, with total responses per block recorded on a counter at the \r\nbottom of the screen). The optimal strategy (in order to minimise number \r\nof aversive reinforcers received) is therefore to make an avoidance \r\nresponse if the stimulus is a CS+, but not otherwise (participants must \r\nlearn the identity of each stimulus through trial and error). \r\nGeneralization of instrumental avoidance is operationalized as avoidance \r\nresponses made on GS+ trials.", "review_status": "True", "id": "tsk_BuPIiFcjBo2aX"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_PT07mIpde9ayt"}, {"id": "con_Vy4e1x3SzIekH"}, {"id": "con_DzqO65o0FRLb3"}], "HASEXTERNALDATASET": [{"id": "dst_RKkkMt5JlWS4O"}]}

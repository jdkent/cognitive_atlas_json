It is more useful than CRT or SRT where it is necessary to control for tremor. The task is divided into five stages, which require increasingly complex chains of responses. In each case, the participant must react as soon as a yellow dot appears. In some stages the dot may appear in one of five locations, and the participant must sometimes respond by using the press-pad, sometimes by touching the screen, and sometimes both.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f84e8ab7af8"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f84ec36494c"}, {"id": "cnt_50f84ecaeb640"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a972"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50ec58d050cf5", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T19:29:10", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f84f0b3f2ab"}, {"id": "cit_50f84f718c002"}, {"id": "cit_50f850f6ba18f"}]}

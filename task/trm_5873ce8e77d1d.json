The paradigm consisted in four categories of blocks. Each block was formed by a set of short events, in which visual instructions related to one or two conditions of the same kind were displayed. These four categories of blocks were characterized as follows: \r\n(1) saccade, in which ocular movements were performed according to the displacement of a fixation cross from the center towards peripheral points in the image displayed; \r\n(2) mimicry of object grasping with right hand, in which the corresponding object was displayed on the screen; \r\n(3) mimic orientation of rhombus, displayed as image background on the screen\r\nTasks of conditions  (2) and (3) were featured by the same visual stimuli in order to capture grasping-specific activity, using\r\nright hand along with fingers; \r\n(4) mental judgement on the left-right direction of a hand displayed as visual stimulus; and\r\n(5) mental judgement on the palmar-dorsal direction of a hand displayed as visual stimulus. \r\nThe first three aforementioned conditions contained one active condition. In contrast, the forth and fifth blocks included two active conditions, referring each one to the relative directions of the hand represented.", "id_user": "usr_583366685f18a", "id": "trm_5873ce8e77d1d"}}

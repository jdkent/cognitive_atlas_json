The outcome probabilities associated with each stimulus are correlated: when the outcome probability of one stimulus switches, the outcome probability of the other stimulus switches too. Hence, you can learn from outcomes on one stimulus about the other stimulus. \r\n\r\nVariants of the task can include a third, control stimulus, with an independent outcome probability.

This test is often used, in conjunction with Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) , before the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, as both these tests help to train the participant for PAL. PRM and SRM contain different elements of PAL and the results considered together help to decide on the exact nature of the cognitive deficit being considered. The participant is presented with a white square, which appears in sequence at five different locations on the screen. In the recognition phase, the participant sees a series of five pairs of squares, one of which is in a place previously seen in the presentation phase. The other square is in a location not seen in the presentation phase. As with the PRM test, locations are tested in the reverse of the presentation order. This sub-test is repeated three more times, each time with five new locations", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f733d7305a1"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f7346907d30"}, {"id": "cnt_50f73471382f8"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b1d5"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50ec58d050cf5", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:15:27", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50f733f8dba24", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:12:56", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50f7340210381", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:13:06", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}]}

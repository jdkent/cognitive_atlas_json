After each video clip, participants judge whether the objects had a mental interaction (an interaction that appears as if the shapes are taking into account each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings and thoughts), Not Sure, or No interaction (i.e., there is no obvious interaction between the shapes and the movement appears random).

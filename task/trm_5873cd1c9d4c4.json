These are the various contrasts obtained by opposing the simple tasks as defined in [Pinel 2007 &#34;Fast reproducible identification and large-scale databasing of individual functional cognitive networks&#34;]. This standard localizer is a simple and fast acquisition procedure based on a 5-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence that can be run as easily and as systematically as an anatomical scan. This protocol captures the cerebral bases of auditory and visual perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation.", "id_user": "usr_583366685f18a", "id": "trm_5873cd1c9d4c4"}}

Now, during the delayed recall (CPFd , participants are shown a series, one at a time, of 40 faces: the 20 study stimuli/faces they were asked to memorize and 20 novel faces, all of which are different from the 20 distracters shown during the CPF. The participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 task is to decide whether they have seen each face before by clicking one of four buttons, presented in a 4-point scale: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefinitely yes\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably yes\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably no\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefinitely no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d using the mouse.

At the beginning of each block of trials, they are shown which criterion line to use for their decisions.  In the criteria with dot stimuli version of the task, participants are asked to decide if a matrix of dots is &#34;big&#34; or &#34;small&#34; compared to a matrix of dots that can differ in size.

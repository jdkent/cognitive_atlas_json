It is a simultaneous visual search task with response latency dissociated from movement time. Efficient performance on this task requires the ability to search among the targets and ignore the distractor patterns which have elements in common with the target. This test can help to differentiate between Parkinson&#39;s disease and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and also between Lewy Body dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The participant is shown a complex visual pattern (the sample) in the middle of the screen, and then, after a brief delay, a varying number of similar patterns is shown in a circle of boxes around the edge of the screen. Only one of these boxes matches the pattern in the centre of the screen, and the participant must indicate which it is by touching it. Reaction time is measured on the basis of the release of the press-pad, which allows for its more accurate measurement.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f852c084fde"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f853460010d"}, {"id": "cnt_50f8535a4f6f2"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b4cd"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50ec58d050cf5", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T19:43:30", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50f85360b9cec", "event_stamp": "2013-01-17T19:39:12", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASEXTERNALDATASET": [{"id": "dst_553fd1cf350cb"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f8538198928"}, {"id": "cit_50f853ddaaa49"}, {"id": "cit_50f85433085b7"}, {"id": "cit_553fd17d07d46"}]}

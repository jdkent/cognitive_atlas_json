The game was originally developed by cognitive psychologists at the University of Illinois, as a tool to study learning and training strategies. Notably, it is one of the few cognitive training tools that has shown transfer of training to real-world performance. Flight students that trained on Space Fortress performed better on a battery of real-world flight tests, and were more likely to be selected to pursue pilot training compared to a no-training control group. Studies have also found that learning Space Fortress with a strategy that involves flexibly shifting attention to different aspects of the game results in improved learning. Thus, the Space Fortress game serves as a great tool for studying how the brain acquires new, complex skills, and how the trained ability can extend to new contexts.

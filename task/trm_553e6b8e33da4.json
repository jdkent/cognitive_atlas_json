The inference problem is embedded in a cover task in which the number corresponded to the horizontal position at which a bag of money would drop from a helicopter concealed behind clouds. The objective is to catch coins in a bucket by predicting where the bag lands, and this is equivalent to inferring the generative mean (i.e., the position of the helicopter) and centering the bucket at that position.  Learning rate can be measured by the shift in the participant&#39;s prediction and the prediction error. \r\n\r\nThe description above, as well as full details of the task: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314009118#sec4", "id_user": "usr_51bc76ae9636c", "id": "trm_553e6b8e33da4"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_553e6d2a395b2"}, {"id": "cnt_553e6d32a3fd7"}, {"id": "cnt_553e6d3f41b03"}, {"id": "cnt_553e6d44d6921"}], "HASEXTERNALDATASET": [{"id": "dst_553e6be31546b"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_553e6c17880f8"}]}

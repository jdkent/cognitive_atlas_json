Subjects are presented with two compound stimuli, each composed of a &#39;line stimulus&#34; and a &#34;shape stimulus&#34;. Thus the stimuli are multi-dimensional, in that they are composed of two separable features (line and shape).  There are 8 different \u00e2\u0080\u009clines\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and 8 different \u00e2\u0080\u009cshapes\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Subjects are told to choose between the two stimuli, and receive feedback on their choices.  The correct choice depends upon the current target, where the target can take on any one of the 8 \u00e2\u0080\u009clines\u00e2\u0080\u009d or 8 \u00e2\u0080\u009cshapes\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  The current target shifts after several trials.  This allows for an inter-dimensional shift, where the subject learns the new correct target within the same dimension (old target: \u00e2\u0080\u009cline 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d, new target \u00e2\u0080\u009cline 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d) or for an extra-dimensional shift, where the subject learns the new target outside of the old dimension (old target: \u00e2\u0080\u009cline 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d new target: \u00e2\u0080\u009cshape 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d).", "id_user": "usr_566738e285cfc", "id": "trm_5667476fc14dd"}}

They test the association of positive and negative words or images with certain concepts such as race, gender, religion, self-esteem, and sexuality. Respondents to the IAT experience a higher (conscious, controlled, explicit, reflective, analytic, rational, etc.) level of mental operation, when they try to overcome the effects of the automatic associations, and thus a longer response time when they answer counter to their implicit associations.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50b6660b1b847"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_50b66686e34f2"}, {"id": "con_50b666a40f0c3"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50b666dabe619"}, {"id": "cnt_50b667617b8fb"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0ad64"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a51c"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50b666e6b3d72", "event_stamp": "2012-11-28T19:32:54", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50b6677767c06", "event_stamp": "2012-11-28T19:35:19", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50b6661f6345c"}, {"id": "cit_50b667b19fe93"}, {"id": "cit_50b667b9016a1"}]}

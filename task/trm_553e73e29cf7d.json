On each trial, a fixation cross is presented followed by a visual prompt (asterisk) and a sequence of five centrally presented words (in lower case). The experimental variable is the predictability of the terminal, target word, represented in four conditions (Congruent == highly predictable,Incongruent == target word is highly predictable, but the prediction was violated by presenting a terminal word that was inappropriate given the context, Scrambled == initial four words did not establish a context for a grammatical sentence and the target word was not predictable, and Letter String == meaningless letter strings of identical consonants as a control). After presentation of the target word, the participant is asked if the sentence is meaningful.

Participants are shown color words (e.g., red, blue, green) printed in congruent or incongruent fonts (as in a Stroop task) such that most stimuli are congruent (80%; e.g., the word \u201cBLUE\u201d in blue font). Congruent stimuli are Go trials requiring a button-press response (eg., button 1). In contrast, participants are to withhold button-presses when either the same color word is repeated on two successive trials (No-Go Rule-1) or an incongruent stimulus is presented (e.g., the word \u201cBLUE\u201d in red font; No-Go Rule-2). Continuously monitoring both No-Go rules is difficult and participants are predisposed to monitor for REPEAT (Rule-1) more so than INCONGRUENT trials (Rule-2). This leads to a sufficient number of errors (~45%), a portion of which remain undetected by participants (~10-20%). The task begins with words presented for 900ms followed by a 600ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). To equate task performance across groups and maintain overall errors at ~45%, task difficulty dynamically adapts based on individual performance by varying the stimulus presentation and ISI durations. Participants indicate \u201cerror awareness\u201d by pressing a separate 'error signaling button' (e.g., button 2) on the trial following a commission error.", "id": "tsk_nzi0bkdoO8a23"}, "HASIMPLEMENTATION": [{"id": "imp_EQvPlPzTMkrZj"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_LqTX6uWA86y04"}]}

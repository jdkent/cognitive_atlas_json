For example subjects choose between option A that is a lottery that wins $2 with probability 0.1 and $1.6 with probability 0.9 (safe bet) and option B that is a lottery that wins $3.85 with probability 0.1 and $0.1 with probability 0.9 (risky bet). The paired lottery choices are structured so that the crossover point to the high-risk lottery can be used to infer the degree of risk aversion.

It is a multiple choice task in which the participant must conceptualize spatial, design and numerical relations that range in difficulty from very easy to increasingly complex [2]. During the PMAT, the participant must click with the mouse on the square he/she thinks best fits in the missing square of the pattern. There are three types of patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 and 1x5 arrangements of squares. Each item has five response choices. Each PMAT form has 24 items and 3 bonus items. There are two forms, PMAT24-A and PMAT24-B. The test is arranged in order of increasing difficulty of items and is discontinued after the participant chooses an incorrect response for any five items. The bonus items are selected based on the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance. There are two forms, PMAT24-A and PMAT24-B.

In this paradigm, participants first provide a set of autobiographical memories, each comprised of a set of details, e.g., a person, place, and object. They later return for a separate session in which they are cued to recall some of these episodes. For the imagination trials, details concerning person, place, and object are experimentally recombined across events, and participants are asked to imagine an event that might occur in the future involving the recombined set of details. Participants press a button once they have constructed the past or future event and after that continue to simulate the event, generating as much detail as possible. This is typically followed by ratings of phenomenological characteristics of the simulated events, e.g., detail or difficulty. \r\n\r\n(description adapted from Addis et al., 2010)", "id_user": "usr_5773c75dae524", "id": "trm_59ed1f7a0ac9c"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_59ed241532991"}, {"id": "con_59ed24533aa21"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d09b10"}, {"id": "trm_5a285423171d9"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_59ed26ac3f228", "event_stamp": "2017-10-22T23:15:56", "id_user": "usr_5773c75dae524"}, {"id": "ind_59ed26d87097f", "event_stamp": "2017-10-22T23:16:40", "id_user": "usr_5773c75dae524"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_59ed1fc71ac48"}, {"id": "cit_59ed1fe965686"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_rkzAKkhmkurzt"}, {"id": "cnt_3Z8dPSnKa4rge"}]}

Each trial begins with a circular token (green or purple) at the center of the screen.  After a random delay, the token turns blue and its value changes from 0 cents to 30 cents.  A white progress bar marks the amount of time the current token had been on the screen, with a maximum length corresponding to 100seconds.  Participants could sell the token at anytime by pressing a key.  Subjects were explicitly instructed that the green and purple tokens might differ in their timing, and to learn the nature of the differences from direct experience.

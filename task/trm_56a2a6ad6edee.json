It was designed as a spatial analog of the California Verbal Learning Test. The sVOLT includes only the first set of trials of a series of 7 sets from the full version (VOLT  [1]. In the first part of this test, participants are shown 10 threedimensional Euclidean shapes that they will be asked to identify for both immediate and delayed recalls (delayed recall = sVOLTd . During the immediate recall (sVOLT , participants are shown a series, one at a time, of 20 three-dimensional Euclidean shapes - the 10 shapes they were asked to memorize mixed with 10 novel shapes. The participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task is to decide whether he/she has seen the shape before by clicking with the mouse on one of four buttons: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDEFINITELY YES\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPROBABLY YES\u00e2\u0080\u009d, &#34;PROBABLY NO&#34; and &#34;DEFINITELY NO&#34;. (NOTE: The original sVOLT had only two response choices: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYES I have seen the shape\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cNO I have not seen the shape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d . Participants have 20 seconds to select a response before the test moves on to the next trial. There are two forms of the sVOLT: the sVOLT-A and sVOLT-B.\r\n", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f", "id": "trm_56a2a6ad6edee"}, "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_56a2a152ad3ca", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T22:12:27", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}, {"id": "tco_56a2a2a68d8a6", "event_stamp": "2016-01-22T22:21:29", "id_user": "usr_569fc42c3002f"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_56a2ad9151928"}, {"id": "cit_56a2adbd49b3c"}, {"id": "cit_56a2b05f6a3cc"}]}

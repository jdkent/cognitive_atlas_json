In the computerized version of this task, three spaceships appear on a screen and the participant must determine if the spaceships are all different or all the same. The spaceships can differ in color, size, or shape type. There are three levels of difficulty.  In the first level, the spaceships must all be identical to be considered the same. In the second level of difficulty, the spaceships are considered the same even if they only share two qualities, and in the third difficulty level, the spaceships only need to share one quality to be considered the same.

The user is required to attend specific target stimuli that are considered important and to ignore other, more frequent stimuli. The target stimuli elicit large P300 response that can easily be classified from epoched EEG. P300 BCI can rely almost on any type of stimuli, that are capable to evoke discernable ERPs - visual, tactile, auditory, etc. P300 BCI paradigm can be adopted for the gamification of ERP studies, as well as for communication in disabled patients.", "id": "tsk_GxjZBNiJorj1K"}, "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_fTCsXri8rAVr4"}], "HASEXTERNALDATASET": [{"id": "dst_PLPSlnb5tVfM2"}, {"id": "dst_JW2lkQ0KuWu1Y"}], "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_18Cl7X96yowMA"}, {"id": "con_3kpoLDjdx7gIz"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_TolNDCLXnVqI9"}, {"id": "cnt_syKNTkzSXtMa9"}], "HASIMPLEMENTATION": [{"id": "imp_8iUN7P0xRJ8a9"}, {"id": "imp_ZU9wYEtGrx0WT"}]}

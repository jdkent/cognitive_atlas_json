The words are relatively short in order to avoid the possible adverse effects of stimulus complexity on the reading of dementing subjects, and they are all &#39;irregular&#39; with respect to the common rules of pronunciation in order to minimise the possibility of reading by phonemic decoding rather than word recognition.\r\nThe subject reads aloud down the list of words and the number of errors made is recorded. WAIS Verbal, Performance and Full-Scale IQs can be predicted from this reading error score by inserting it into the appropriate formulae.\r\n(Hazel E.

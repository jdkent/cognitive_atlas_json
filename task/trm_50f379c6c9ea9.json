The tastants are each applied to the tip of the tongue as well as swished around in the whole mouth and are rated on a generalized labeled magnitude scale (gLMS). The gLMS is a measure of perceived intensity, with seven anchor labels provided (Strongest imaginable, Very strong, Strong, Moderate, Weak, Barely detectable, No sensation). Participants can rate their intensity by clicking with a computer mouse on any point on the scale from Strongest imaginable to No sensation. The computer records the exact location of the response. A score from 0-100 on a semi-logarithmic scale is produced for each of the four items (quinine whole mouth, salt whole mouth, quinine tip of tongue, salt tip of tongue), corresponding to the point on the gLMS where the participant clicked. A higher score represents greater perceived intensity of the tastant.

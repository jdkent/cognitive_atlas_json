After each presentation, the participant is asked to recall as many of the words as he/she can. The Rey is one of the most widely studied measures of memory and has been used in different languages, cultures and ethnic groups around the world. The test can be administered as a supplement to the PSMT for even more detailed study of episodic memory, or as an accommodation in place of PSMT for those with significant visual impairment.", "id_user": "usr_4cf5de07654c8", "id": "trm_4da88ae0f2952"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50eb42b349127"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a1f4"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_57965368237ec", "event_stamp": "2016-07-25T18:01:56", "id_user": "usr_579611e01221d"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50eb42bc1c900", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T21:48:44", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50eb42c394bed", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T21:48:51", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50eb434adbb9f"}, {"id": "cit_50eb453cdb013"}, {"id": "cit_50eb458ac3c89"}]}

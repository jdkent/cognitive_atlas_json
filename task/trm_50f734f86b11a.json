The participant is shown a series of faces which appear on the screen briefly and asked to identify the emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise and fear). One hundred and eighty stimuli, which are computer morphed images derived from the facial features of real individuals each showing a specific emotion, are displayed on the screen, one at a time, in two blocks of ninety. Each face is displayed for a short while (200ms) and then immediately covered up, and then six buttons are displayed, each describing an emotion which could be portrayed in the photograph. The participant must decide which is the appropriate button to describe the emotion and touch the button. There are fifteen different photographs for each of the six emotions, each showing different levels of intensity.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50f734f86b11a"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50f73673c04d8"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b665"}, {"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b4b5"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50ec58d050cf5", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:24:05", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50f7363e1ff7b", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:22:38", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50f73654ad345", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:23:00", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50f736666b82a", "event_stamp": "2013-01-16T23:23:18", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50f73516e8cdc"}, {"id": "cit_50f735de2f6e1"}, {"id": "cit_50f7361e75715"}]}

It measures how much difficulty a person might have hearing in a noisy environment. A recorded voice instructs the participant to listen to and then repeat words. The task becomes increasingly difficult as the background noise gets louder. The best score that can be attained (35 correct) for either ear is -2.0 dB S/N, and the worst score (0 correct) is 26.0 dB S/N. Lower scores, therefore, are indicative of better performance on this test.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50eb0a01bfd05"}, "HASCONDITION": [{"id": "con_50eb0a8e319e8"}, {"id": "con_50eb0acb0b7d8"}], "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50eb0b3d09ef0"}, {"id": "cnt_50eb0b44d1ca2"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0995e"}], "INBATTERY": [{"id": "tco_50f48408441d0", "event_stamp": "2013-01-15T15:54:07", "id_user": "usr_49a467bf4e0db"}], "HASINDICATOR": [{"id": "ind_50eb0b5c56336", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T17:52:28", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}, {"id": "ind_50eb0b7c1d29c", "event_stamp": "2013-01-07T17:53:00", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50eb0c5f6f763"}, {"id": "cit_50eb0c93e0779"}, {"id": "cit_50eb0cc53ea40"}]}

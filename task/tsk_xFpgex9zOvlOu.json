On gain trials they either win $1 or $0. On loss trials they either lose $1 or $0. The probability of winning or losing varies from trial to trial from 0.1 to 0.9 and is explicitly displayed in the form of a pie chart. The participants' task is to indicate whether they would like to reveal the outcome of the lottery or not, by selecting between two offers, each representing a different probability of having the outcome revealed. Whether they receive information about the outcome of the lottery or not is non-instrumental because the outcome of all lotteries are added to the participant's final payment, regardless of whether information was obtained. Therefore, information about the outcome of each lottery had no bearing on participants' actual earnings.\r\nAfter selecting the offer (high or low probability of receiving information), participants are presented with a green knowledge cue, indicating that the outcome of the lottery is about to be shown to them ('WIN', 'ZERO' or 'LOSS'), or with a red ignorance cue, indicating that a non-informative outcome cue would follow ('XXXX'). Color associations are counterbalanced across participants.", "id": "tsk_xFpgex9zOvlOu"}}

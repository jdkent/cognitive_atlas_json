The task cue indicates whether to respond to the colored number based on parity (odd-even), magnitude (higher-lower than 5) or color (orange-blue).  There are three different tasks, and each task has two task cues that evoke the task action.  For example, the task cue could be either parity or odd-even.  Both of these task cues indicate that the subject should judge the subsequent colored number based on whether it is an odd or even number.

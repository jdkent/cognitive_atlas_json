In this game, a proposer is charged with splitting a sum of money with a partner. The responder decides either to accept or reject this proposed offer. If accepted, the money is split as suggested, but if rejected then neither player receives anything. The parterns can be a combination of real people, computers. Offers are preceded by a picture of the partner for that round, and partner pictures are randomly paired to an offer amount.

Each lottery can yield one of two monetary outcomes (all positive outcomes, no losses). The range of magnitudes of the outcomes is {0,50}, the range of probabilities for each outcome {0,1}.

Subjects are assumed to choose mostly the lottery with the higher subjective value. ", "id": "tsk_wPIAFIkSlX3Tm"}}

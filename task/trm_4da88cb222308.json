The participants are asked to recall the sequence of pictures demonstrated over two learning trials; sequence length varies from 6-18 pictures, depending on age. Participants are given credit for each adjacent pair of pictures they correctly place (i.e., if pictures in locations 7 and 8 are placed in that order and adjacent to each other anywhere, such as slots 1 and 2, one point is awarded), up to the maximum value for the sequence, which is one less than the sequence length. (That is, if 18 pictures are in the sequence, the maximum score is 17 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the number of adjacent pairs of pictures \r\nthat exist).

Subjects had to learn one of three key responses for each of the 18 stimuli. In the &#34;flat&#34; condition, the 18 stimuli to 3 responses mapping was arbitrary, requiring subjects to individually learn each of the 18 associations. In a hierarchical condition, the colored borders indicated whether &#34;orientation&#34; or &#34;shape&#34; determined the response. This simplifies performance if subjects learn this hierarchical structure.", "id_user": "usr_566738e285cfc", "id": "trm_5667441c338a7"}}

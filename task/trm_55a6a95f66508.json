Dysfunctional impulsivity is a type of impulsivity that is associated with a tendency to make quick decisions when this type of decision-making is non-optimal. This differs from functional impulsivity which is a tendency to make quick decisions where this is optimal. As dysfunctional impulsivity is often associated with a failure to consider the consequences of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior, it can often lead to life difficulties.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_impulsivity", "id_user": "usr_51bc76ae9636c", "id": "trm_55a6a95f66508"}}

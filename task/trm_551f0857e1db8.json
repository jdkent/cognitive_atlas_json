Efficiency of the alerting network is examined by changes in reaction time resulting from a warning signal. Efficiency of orienting is examined by changes in the reaction time that accompany cues indicating where the target will occur. The efficiency of the executive network is examined by requiring the participant to respond by pressing two keys indicating the direction (left or right) of a central arrow surrounded by congruent, incongruent or neutral flankers.", "id_user": "usr_4e42a3196fbcd", "id": "trm_551f0857e1db8"}, "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d09902"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_5532c52d53443"}, {"id": "cit_4e496a66946fb"}, {"id": "cit_5532c5d6f2da0"}]}

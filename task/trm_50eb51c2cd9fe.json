Participants are seated in a chair with their feet touching the ground. With the elbow bent to 90 degrees and the arm against the trunk, wrist at neutral, participants squeeze the Jamar Plus Digital dynamometer as hard as they can for a count of three. The dynamometer provides a digital reading of force in pounds.

In Sperling&#39;s version of the task, participants are cued to recall just one subset. Due to the fact that participants did not know which row would be cued for recall, performance in the partial report condition can be regarded as a random sample of an observer&#39;s memory for the entire display. Another version involves participants responding by pressing a button when they see only a certain stimulus out of a set appear.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_50b65ef129e23"}, "HASCONTRAST": [{"id": "cnt_50b6603a36ae2"}], "ASSERTS": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a4f9"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_50b660751a244"}, {"id": "cit_50b6615f9f16d"}]}

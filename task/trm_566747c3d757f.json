Each dimension has three exemplars so all exemplars are on the screen at any time. One dimension (e.g., color) determines reward, and one exemplar in this dimension (e.g. &#34;red&#34;) has a higher probability of reward than the others (75% vs. 25%). If rewarded, the subject earns 1 point (the subject is instructed to maximize points). After 15-25 trials the relevant dimension and higher probability feature is switched. This switch is either signaled to the participant (in most versions so far) or not (in one paper).", "id_user": "usr_566738e285cfc", "id": "trm_566747c3d757f"}}

The study gathered and analyzed thousands of brain scans, genetic profiles, and biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid that are used to measure the progress of disease or the effects of treatment.</p>", "id": "tco_57965368237ec", "flag_for_curator": 1}, "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_5796561f97033"}]}

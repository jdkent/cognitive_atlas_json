These are typically classified into binocular cues that require input from both eyes and monocular cues that require the input from just one eye.  Binocular cues include stereopsis, yielding depth from binocular vision through exploitation of parallax. Monocular cues include size: distant objects subtend smaller visual angles than near objects.  A third class of cues requires synthetic integration of binocular and monocular cues.", "id_user": "usr_0000000000", "id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a095"}, "CLASSIFIEDUNDER": [{"id": "ctp_C1"}]}

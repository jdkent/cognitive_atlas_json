It results from a deficit in the lexical route for word reading. As a result, the reader needs to rely on the sublexical for reading, reading by converting each letter or group of letters (grapheme) to a sound (phoneme). Surface dyslexia is characterised by slow reading (because reading via grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is slower than reading via the lexical route); it is also characterised by incorrect reading aloud of irregular words (such as talk, sure, none, and comb).

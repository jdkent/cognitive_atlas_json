They are the processes by which creative concepts are first born. These processes are highly visible in extreme acts of creativity, but they are also evident in ordinary, everyday cognition.  Examples (from Ward et al.(cited below)) include memory retrieval, association formation among information retrieved from memory, combinations of structures retrieved from memory, the synthesis of new structures, the transformation of retrieved structures into &#34;new forms,&#34; analogical transfer between domains, and &#34;categorical reduction,&#34; which involves reducing existing structures to &#34;more primitive constituents&#34;.  \r\n\r\nExploratory processes are the processes used to explore the structures produced by generative processes. Examples of exploratory processes (given by Ward, et al.) include searching retrieved structures for &#34;novel attributes,&#34; searching for &#34;metaphorical implications,&#34; searching for possible functions, &#34;the evaluation of structures from different perspectives or within different contexts,&#34; interpretation of structures from the perspective of the problem(s) to be solved, and &#34;the search for various practical or conceptual limitations that are suggested by the structures.&#34;\r\n", "id_user": "usr_0000000000", "id": "trm_4a3fd79d09f2a"}, "MEASUREDBY": [{"id": "cnt_4e08ed0d8815f"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_4da37d09aec36"}]}

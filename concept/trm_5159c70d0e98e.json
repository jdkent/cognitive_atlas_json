Homeostatic and circadian processes regulate the propensity for wakefulness and sleep. Sleep is a reversible state, characterized by postural recumbence, behavioral quiescence, and reduced responsiveness. It involves predictable cycling of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). It is affected by experiences during wakefulness, and has restorative and transformative effects that optimize neurobehavioral functions during wakefulness.", "id_user": "usr_4de5345b3b6a8", "id": "trm_5159c70d0e98e"}, "MEASUREDBY": [{"id": "cnt_52583b494605a"}, {"id": "cnt_525d86eb4aeaa"}, {"id": "cnt_5585c855ab224"}], "HASCITATION": [{"id": "cit_52b811ddec073"}]}

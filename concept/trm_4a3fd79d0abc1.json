Thus, object A may be rated as more similar to object B than to object C despite a greater difference in some physical metric (such as height or width) between objects A and C than between objects A and B. This may differ across modalities: for example, two objects may be rated as more similar when seen than when touched. However, the physical, objective similarity between the two objects remains the same regardless of which modality is used to explore them.", "id_user": "usr_0000000000", "id": "trm_4a3fd79d0abc1"}, "MEASUREDBY": [{"id": "cnt_52728216c4a99"}, {"id": "cnt_5272813e7ad58"}], "CLASSIFIEDUNDER": [{"id": "ctp_C1"}]}

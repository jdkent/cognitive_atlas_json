Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin (1967) defined concept attainment (or concept learning) as &#34;the search for and listing of attributes that can be used to distinguish exemplars from non exemplars of various categories.&#34; More simply put, concepts are the mental categories that help us classify objects, events, or ideas and each object, event, or idea has a set of common relevant features. Thus, concept learning is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups or categories that contain concept-relevant features with groups or categories that do not contain concept-relevant features.\r\n", "id_user": "usr_0000000000", "id": "trm_4a3fd79d09dc1"}, "CLASSIFIEDUNDER": [{"id": "ctp_C5"}]}

It consists of a phonological store and an articulatory rehearsal process. The phonological store can hold speech-based information, subject to a rapid decay. The articulatory rehearsal process can refresh the decaying representation by reading it off and feeding it back to the store. It also serves to convert visually presented information (such as written words) into phonological codes and register them into the phonological store.

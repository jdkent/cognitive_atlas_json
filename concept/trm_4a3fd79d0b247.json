Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a conversation, reaction such as when they name a picture or read aloud a written word, or a vocal imitation such as in speech repetition.  Speech production is not the same as language production since language can also be produced manually by signs.\r\n", "id_user": "usr_0000000000", "id": "trm_4a3fd79d0b247"}, "MEASUREDBY": [{"id": "cnt_4df6a3169f42a"}, {"id": "cnt_4e0253808fe82"}, {"id": "cnt_4e02654a92111"}, {"id": "cnt_525d84fa886ed"}, {"id": "cnt_52718a781a09a"}], "KINDOF": [{"id": "trm_4a3fd79d0a78d"}], "CLASSIFIEDUNDER": [{"id": "ctp_C6"}]}
